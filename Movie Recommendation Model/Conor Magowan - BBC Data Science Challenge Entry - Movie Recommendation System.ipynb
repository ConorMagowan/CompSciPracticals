    "#### Why did you pick the specific technique(s) you used? \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a range of techniques available for creating recommendation systems. I decided to opt for a collaborative filtering approach, as it is known to work well for Netflix Recommendation Systems. More specifically, I tried out using SVD (singular value decomposition - a matrix factorization technique) as it leverages a latent factor model to capture the similarities between users and items. Essentially, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem, and the leading algorithm for this application is SVD (see http://surpriselib.com/ for testing various algorithms). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What parameters matter in this case? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the parameters of interest are the movieId's, ratings and userId's. This is because we are trying to predict which users behave similarly to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What assumptions does the model make about the data that it is being trained on? \n",
    "\n",
    "Users who have similar preferences in the past are likely to have similar preferences in the future. It is this assumption which allows us to take a user's history and extrapolate into their future and predict items which they might enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How may the model adapt over time and continue to provide useful predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "As movie interests change, model could be adapted to add increased weight to ratings given out recently (can check this by checking the timestamp value in the dataframe). This way, as the interests of certain individuals change over time, the system captures the changing interest and the recommendations are adjusted and improved as time progresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could also incorporate item-based collaborative filtering into our model to create a hybrid. This would furthure ensure that the model doesn't break down if peoples preferences change."
